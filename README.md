# Permit data analysis
The analysis starts with a download of permit data from Socrata open data system.<br><br>
https://github.com/alxfed/permit-data-analysis/blob/master/readin_permits.py<br><br>
The downloaded data is stored in individual tables of an sqlite database for each type separately.<br><br>
